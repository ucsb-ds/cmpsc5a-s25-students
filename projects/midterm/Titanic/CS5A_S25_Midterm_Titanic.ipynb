        "The *R.M.S. Titanic* was a British luxury passenger and mail carrying ocean liner that was operated by the White Star Line. It was the largest ship afloat at the time of its creation, and the ship was thought to be unsinkable. The *Titanic* began its maiden voyage from Southampton, United Kingdom on April 10, 1912 en route to New York City. However, the *Titanic* struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on April 14, 1912, and the ship sank in the Atlantic Ocean during the morning of April 15, 1912.\n",

The dataset contains information of 1309 passengers, and it does not contain information about the *Titanic* crew. A total of 2240 people (passengers and crew) sailed on the *Titanic*. The dataset originated from the [Encyclopedia Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/), which has a goal of telling the story of every single person that traveled on the *Titanic*. The dataset is consistently being evolved, and therefore some data is missing, which is common in many real-world datasets. The missing data are marked by `nan`.\n",
