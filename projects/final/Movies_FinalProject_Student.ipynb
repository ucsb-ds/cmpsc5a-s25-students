    "- “Alice will work on Q1-5 and Bob will do Q6-10. Each of us will make the slides that correspond to the problems we did.” \n",
    "- “We will meet in person to do the whole assignment as a team, switching up who is typing. Whoever is not currently typing will still help by checking documentation pages for the typist and advising the typist as they write code. Alice will make the first half of the slides, Bob will make the second half.” \n",

    "**Deadline:** The final project notebook is due Thursday, March 13th, 2025 at 11:59pm PT. The final project presentation slides are due by 10:00am PT on Friday, March 14th, 2025. Unlike labs, **no late submissions are allowed**. After presentations are complete, we will send out a survey where you say what you ended up doing and whether your teammate(s) held up their end of the bargain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:** For full credit, you must complete all the questions and submit to Gradescope. You may still change your answers before the project deadline - only your final submission will be graded for correctness. Only one partner needs to submit the notebook to Gradescope, and they will need to add the other two group members as members on Gradescope. See [How to Add Group Member in Gradescope](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members). **After they submit, all group members should open their Gradescope accounts and see that a submission has been processed. Be sure that the final notebook has all the ChatGPT prompts used by all the team members**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Presentation:** Your group will need to create a presentation slide deck and give a 6-8 minute oral presentation during your assigned time slot. Presentations must use slides. Your group is not allowed to scroll through your notebook during the presentation. All slides must be uploaded to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17r2EyxJYd40E7OAldljNb7QcjD_YikWh?usp=sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Project Rubric:** The rubric for the Final Project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LCjgJ_OTntaBKx6abFevrOupjzK2Iw0G/edit).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTES:** \n",
    "- You are not limited to just one solution code cell, one prompt cell and one workflow cell for each question. Use as many of each as you like to ensure your notebook is presented well, easy-to-read, and has all the required plots and intermediate tables visible to show how you deduced that answer.\n",
    "- None of the questions are created in a way that will allow you to just give a one line answer. Remember, if your answer is just a one line answer, you are probably missing something.\n",
    "- Every group's answers may be different based on the approach you take for data analysis. Others may have visually presented it with a graph that may be different from yours, or filtered the table in a different way. That does not mean yours is wrong. We are looking for diversity in how information is displayed and there are more than one correct answers for each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners:** You will work with two or three other partners (total three or four in a group); your partners can be from any lab section. **Please sign-up with your partners on the [final project sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mT-_lz-b4fx5X1Ma7wtxio_rpFeWxfBz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109499873917928324217&rtpof=true&sd=true) using your UCSB email by Monday, March 3, 2025 at 5:00pm PT.** If you have less than three people, please check the sheet on Tuesday, March 4, 2025 to see if you were assigned a random partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:** Don't share your code with anybody but your partners. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem. Since the problems are open-ended, they can have various different answers. What is important is the approach you take to solve your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support:** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Ed, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Ed post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, please talk to your TA or ULA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice:** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **TRY NOT TO** reuse the variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You **never** have to use just one line in this project or any others. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!"
