        "A/B testing is a statistical method used to compare two groups (Group A and Group B) to determine if there is a significant difference between them. It's commonly used in decision-making, such as testing changes in website design, product features, or marketing strategies.\n",

        "\n",
        "Compute a test statistic (e.g., the difference in means or medians) to summarize the difference between the groups.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Shuffle or resample the data to simulate what differences might look like if there were no true effect. This generates a null distribution. Plot the null distribution and locate the observed statistic (our red dot!). If the observed statistic is far from the bulk of the null distribution, it's evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",

        "5) Time to make a decision!\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculate the p-value - the probability of observing a difference as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed difference, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Compare the p-value to a significance threshold (e.g., 0.05) to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. See the section above for more on hypotheses testing, test statistic and p-value!"

        "You can observe that even though there is some distance between the averages of the two distributions, there is a significant amount of overlap happening between the histograms. This raises the question of whether the difference reflects just chance or a difference in the distributions in the larger population of universities.\n",

        "Again, define your *null* and *alternative* hypotheses. As a *null* hypothesis you can assume that the two distributions are identical but the differences that we observed on the graph above are attributed to chance. As an *alternative* hypothesis you can assume that among all the universities, the ones that have an overall score above the average, have a higher research quality score while the ones that have an overall score below the average, have a lower research quality score.\n",

Yes and that is because the alternative hypothesis compares the averages of the research quality score for the two groups of universities."
